// Package nook provides a comprehensive collection of character information from the video game series, Animal Crossing.
//
// This package focuses on organizing and classifying characters into two main categories: residents and villagers.
// Residents are essential characters in the game world, playing unique roles and often serving as quest givers. They cannot be invited as homeowners to the player's town, city, or island. Examples of residents include Isabelle, Tom Nook, and Guliver.
// Villagers, on the other hand, form the larger world population and can be invited to stay in the player's town, city, or island. They possess distinct personalities, homes, and can receive gifts. Alfonso, Tabby, and Eggbert are among the charming villagers you may encounter.
//
// To manage the vast number of characters in the series and potential naming overlaps, this package thoughtfully categorizes characters based on their animal type. For example, the name Petunia is shared by both a Cow and a Rhinoceros character, while Snooty is the name of both a wolf character and a personality type.
