// Nook exports basic information for characters that appear in the video game series Animal Crossing.
//
// Specifically this package centers on the organisation and classification of residents versus villagers, as well as
// defining the common attributes between them.
//
// Residents in the context of this package are Animal Crossing characters that cannot
// be invited as home owners within the players town, city, or island. Residents perform a special role within the world
// and often are quest givers. An example of a Resident would be Isabelle, Tom Nook or Guliver.
//
// Villagers are Animal Crossing characters that can be invited to stay in the players town, city or island,
// and make up the larger world population. Characters such as Alfonso, Tabby and Eggbert are all examples of Villagers. Villagers
// can be given gifts, have personalities and homes.
//
// This package separates and organises Animal Crossing characters by their animal type. This is a requirement due to the large number
// of characters there are in the series, and that some characters overlap with other components in name.
// An example of this is the name Petunia, who is both a Cow and a Rhinoceros. Another example is Snooty, which is the name of one of the wolves and a personality type.
//
// The information for this package has largely been sourced from various Wiki pages across the internet.
//
// All contributions and corrections are welcome and encouraged.
