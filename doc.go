// Package nook exports basic information for characters that appear in the video game series Animal Crossing.
//
// Specifically this package focuses on the organisation and classification of residents and villagers.
// Residents in the context of this package are Animal Crossing characters that cannot
// be invited to live within the players town, city, village or island.
// Villagers are Animal Crossing characters that live in homes within the players world but do not have
// a special function, such as Tom Nook or Isabelle.
//
// This package separates Animal Crossing characters by their animal type. This is a requirement due to the number
// of characters there are in the game series, and that some characters have overlaps in names with other villagers
// or other elements that compose a character. An example of this is the character Petunia.
//
// The information for this package has largely been sourced from various Wikipedia packages across the internet.
//
// All contributions and corrections are welcome and encouraged.
