# Character
Character exports the key values for Animal Crossing characters.

## Contents
Character contains the various Animal Crossing characters. Each character is grouped by its animal type. This was a choice due to some characters having an overlap in their names. It also helps to keep the repository glancable, and allows the developer to know the type of animal the character is, without adding
extra prefixes to the variable name. It also allows for each package to export the appropriate scope and separates responsibilities by type. It was also found that GitHub will only show a maximum of 1000 files within the Web UI. As tests are added and functionality grows, if all files existed in the same directory it would likely exceed this limit.
